# textpocalypse
A text-based post-apocalyptic survival game.

Currently in the pre-prototype phase. AKA it's not really any kind of "game" yet.

Goals:
* fun (duh)
* moddability
* support for screen readers
* gentle learning curve
* complex and punishing, but not to the point of being overly frustrating

Non-goals:
* hyper-realism
* having as many features as possible
