# textpocalypse
A text-based post-apocalyptic survival game.

Currently in the pre-prototype phase. AKA it's not really any kind of "game" yet.

Goals:
* fun (duh)
* moddability
* support for screen readers
* gentle learning curve
* complex and punishing, but not to the point of being overly frustrating

Non-goals:
* fancy graphics
* hyper-realism
* having as many features as possible
* being an MMO

Planned features (in no particular order):
* base building
* "survival needs" (hunger, thirst, etc.)
* stats/skills
* combat
* crafting
* mini-map
* audio
* environmental hazards (extreme cold, radiation, etc.)
* multiplayer
